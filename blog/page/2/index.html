  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The fact that some programmers are ten times better than others is widely cited and gained a lot of exposure thanks to bloggers like Joel Spolsky. The original experiment to uncover this effect is over 40 years old, and yet the reasons why some are so much more effective than others is poorly understood, in the research and especially among programmers in the field.</p>

<p>This post will hopefully be the start of a series of posts on the differences between the best, worst and median programmers as seen in factors of ten difference in productivity, even when experiments control for experience. I&#8217;ll delve into how an individual programmer can become more like the most effective and productice programmers and how small teams, also affected by large differences in productivity, can make themeselves more competitive and productive. We&#8217;ll tour the psychological studies and mine the software engineering studies to find out what has been proven to work.</p>

<p>Based on the research I&#8217;ve done so far, likely future topics include: increasing efficiency, avoiding rework through design best practices, accurate requirements, focus on quality, doing less through simplicity and reuse, and team programming methodologies such as Agile and CCMI.</p>

<p>Oh, if this sounds like a scholarly research paper &#8230; that&#8217;s because it is based on a paper I did. But now with the new format I can dig even deeper and spend more time on specific issues that didn&#8217;t fit the audience of the actual paper. Hooray for the internet and stay tuned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m currently a TA for BYU&#8217;s intro to programming class (CS 142) which is fun and interesting and a good opportunity to cement the intro concepts in my mind by teaching and explaining them as simply as possible.</p>

<p>There was one negative about being a TA. We had to stare at this all day:
<img src="/images/HelpQueueOldTA.png"></p>

<p>This is the Help Queue as viewed by a TA, which sits open eternally, (while on shift at least) watching us like those annoying people who read over your shoulder, while you are trying to read some programming article or work on the wiki or run through next week&#8217;s lab. Then all of a sudden it&#8217;s like the bat signal, interrupting what you&#8217;re doing, because somebody, somewhere, needs help.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s fine and dandy but there are two problems with it though: it&#8217;s ugly and it doesn&#8217;t quite work the way we the TA&#8217;s or the students like.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Ants AI Challenge is an very cool competition to test and improve your coding chops. Essentially you write a program to control a colony of ants like the Bugger Queen from Ender&#8217;s Game would.</p>

<p>The official website does a pretty good job of getting you started, but I&#8217;ll give you some reccomendations having recently run through the startup process.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I mentioned array based programming yesterday as one of the paradigms to consider when choosing a new programming language. If you want a good reason why you should consider them, take a look at this video of Conway&#8217;s Game of Life in APL, one of a few Array Based Programming Languages:</p>

<p>For some more craziness see some <a href="https://github.com/kevinlawler/kona/wiki/Project-Euler-Code-Golf">code golf for Project Euler Problems using K</a>, another array based language. Remember though, this is code golf, so solutions should be expected to be hard to understand and much less readable than production code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Choosing A Language</h1>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>When choosing a language to program in there are usually many factors that help you make the decision. The one most commonly relied on is probably familiarity. That is often okay because it is often the correct answer for the more important question, &#8220;Which language will help me get this project done best?&#8221; Usually the answer is the language you know best.</p>

<p>When I don&#8217;t have to use a language I already know for business reasons or expediency, I try and pick a language that will expand my mind, even if I don&#8217;t expect to use it for something &#8220;serious&#8221; or for pay.</p>

<p>Why do I struggle to accomplish the same tasks I can blaze through in Java or C++? I promise it&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m a glutton for punishment. I do it because knowing more than one language allows me to step out of the &#8220;I&#8217;m programming in X&#8221; mindset, where my solutions and thinking are restricted by language X. I want to have all of the ideas from programming available to me as I think about and solve the problem. Then I can implement those ideas in whichever language I end up using.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>Alright, by this point you&#8217;re hopefully on board with the idea that the next language you learn should expand your mind. Keeping that in mind, how should we choose our next language?</p>

<p>The important thing to understand is that most programming languages are more alike than they are different. Usually this is great. Once you&#8217;ve learned one programming language it is much easier to learn a second. For example it is not too hard for a C++ programmer to get used to Java, or even for a Java programmer to switch to Python or Ruby. The major ideas between these languages are mostly the same. A programmer who is switching will spend most of their learning time getting used to the libraries i.e. where everything they are used to is at.</p>

<p>These large similarities make it harder for us to pick a programming language that will be sufficiently different from what we are used to. If we don&#8217;t pick something weird enough we won&#8217;t get the kind of mental challenge and growth we are looking for.</p>

<p>A helpful tool to figure out how similar languages are is to group them into paradigms. I&#8217;m going to assume that your first or most recent experience is in an imperative / Object-Oriented language like Java or C++. If that&#8217;s not the case then I&#8217;d recommend starting there so that you can communicate easily with the majority of the profession who did start there.</p>

<p>If that doesn&#8217;t describe you, make a list of the languages that you know and cross off any of the paradigms that they fit. If you&#8217;re not sure, Wikipedia can help you out. Then pick a language from the remaining paradigms that interests you the most.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve only listed one example for each paradigm. This is because an exhaustive list is 1. impossible, 2. exhausting to put together and 3. nobody will be satisfied when you&#8217;re done. If you don&#8217;t like my choice for a paradigm, choose your own. That&#8217;s fine. Great even. The best language to learn is one where you know you can get some help. If that help is someone you know in person, even better. That&#8217;s why when you see my plan for the future, you shouldn&#8217;t be surprised that two of them aren&#8217;t even on my primary list. My roommate right now is pretty good at Haskell and (almost) always available to answer questions in person. As for Racket instead of Scheme, there are <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/">good</a> <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Books/ProgLangs/">textbooks</a> and <a href="http://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~jay/home/">one of my professors</a> knows Racket <strong>really well</strong>.</p>

<p>Anyways &#8230;</p>

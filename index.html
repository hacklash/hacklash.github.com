  <div class="entry-content"><p>My new project is to write a deforestation macro for Racket. Since I&#8217;ll be spending a lot of time on that in the next few months and there will probably be a corresponding amount of related content here on the blog, for the rest of the post I&#8217;ll unpack that sentence for you so you can follow along in the future. Read on to get a grounding in deforestation and Racket macros.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In order to expand my mind, I&#8217;ve been exploring different languages, but sometimes I&#8217;ve had to come back to the first language I learned in depth: Java. And when I do, the thing I miss most is first class, higher order functions. That and pattern matching.</p>

<p>Let me show you what I mean:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230; and functional programming.</p>

<blockquote><p>The most important thing I have done as a programmer in recent years is to aggressively pursue static code analysis.  Even more valuable than the hundreds of serious bugs I have prevented with it is the change in mindset about the way I view software reliability and code quality.</p><footer><strong>John Carmack, #AltDevBlogADay</strong> <cite><a href='http://altdevblogaday.com/2011/12/24/static-code-analysis/'>altdevblogaday.com/2011/12/24/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Now if you don&#8217;t know who that is, that&#8217;s ok, but out of the people in industry that I know, which to be fair isn&#8217;t many, John Carmack is the programmer that I repect the most. It&#8217;s not just because he created some very popular games (Doom and Quake for instance) but that he essentially created the western game industry as we know it by creating whole new graphics techniques.</p>

<p>First he wrote the first all-software 2d game engine for Commander Keane, and then he created the whole 3d games genre with Doom. The techniques he developed and even a decent chunk of the code that John Carmack has written lives in practically every 3d western game you&#8217;ve ever played. Wow.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really glad that Carmack recognizes the importance of static analysis and functional programming languages on code quality, and its good to hear when reasearch we have about software productivity is supported by luminaries in industry. I&#8217;ve started the video where he begins talking about static analysis which goes until 1:12:35.</p>

<p><em>Stay til then and you&#8217;ll hear him recommend Haskell and Ocaml, which makes me smile.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If the juxtaposition seems strange to you, I agree with you that at first glance there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much in common between the two. If you&#8217;ve chalked it up the strangeness of the author and moved on to something else I wouldn&#8217;t blame you, but I still think you&#8217;re wrong.</p>

<p>Programming languages and sheet music share some interesting historical similarities besides their importantance as mathematically grounded tools for capturing and spreading ideas. Very different ideas.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Editorial stuff</h2>

<p>This is the <a href="http://brunneng.blogspot.com/2011/12/google-ai-challenge-2011-ants.html">original</a> but I got tired of reading the Google Translation and thought that more people would enjoy reading the postmortem in native(-ish) English. I&#8217;d like to thank GreenTea for linking to this and for any Russian speakers, proshu prosheniye za oshibki perovedeniya.
Before we begin, here is the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ants2011/">code for the final bot</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Begin Translation</strong></p>

<p>As I write this post the finals of the Google AI Contest 2011 - Ants is in full swing. The organizers are gradually cutting off the weaker bots to allow the stronger ones to play more. According to the timer on the <a href="http://ants.aichallenge.org">official site</a> the winner will be announced in 1 day, 5 hours, 35 minutes and 5, 4, 3, 2 &#8230; seconds.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, what was I saying? At the moment <a href="http://ants.aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=398">my bot GreenTea</a> is in third place (<em>Ed. it finished in second place</em>). And it is the focus of this post. I don&#8217;t even know where best to start since so much effort and time was invested, beginning with the beta itself before hills were added to the game &#8230;</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s beta ended up dragging on for an inexcusable amount of time. This greatly undermined my faith in enthusiasm and in open source. Then suddenly the developers wrote on the site &#8220;Sponsored by Google&#8221; and then an intense commotion began to stir as well as some commits. Come on! Although better that than the alternative :) - I really thought that it was going to stall at the beta stage and that would be it &#8230; And the whole beta (I can&#8217;t even remember how long anymore, 4 months?) I coded something little by little, adding and improving.</p>

<p>If there&#8217;s a reason I love this type of competition, it&#8217;s because there is LOTS of time. You don&#8217;t have to hurry or rush: you can sit down, think everything through, try stuff, test, make a change &#8230; make 5 more changes, do some more testing, etc. Basically its enjoyable to program within my level of understanding.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Phew. The Google AI contest closed for entries last night. I had been working on a bot since the start of the contest, but I gave it up after running into timeout issues that I couldn&#8217;t track down.</p>

<p>With 36 hours to the deadline I jumped back into the game, read through the forums and decided to try a different approach than I had been pursuing. The code is ugly and there are almost no comments (none if you count only those that will make sense to anyone else) but I thought that this blog could use some more code on it, and some of you may be interested in how my diffusion approach looks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Don&#8217;t watch TV news, especially the 24 hour news coverage. The incentives are aligned so that news is fast, inaccurate and shocking, and often inaccurate in order to be shocking.</p>

<p>A number of studies have consistently shown that TV news makes people more stupid, i.e. more misinformed, more irrational, more confused, and less able to draw reasonable conclusions or make good decisions.</p>

<p>Instead take the time to accomplish or progress towards your goals. I&#8217;ve slowly been cutting down on my TV and for fun internet browsing. It actually makes a difference in how I feel about the direction of my life. Not so much because I&#8217;m &#8220;wasting&#8221; less time, but that I am moving towards my goals. And that feels good. TV news should be the easiest to cut from your life, mostly because it&#8217;s crap. If I want news I&#8217;ll catch some NPR or read the Economist, the more leisurely news schedule is actually a good thing.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t believe me that TV news is crap?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Algorithms are important. And actually interesting too, especially if you get away from the dry textbooks and into some applications.</p>

<p>This presentation does that with minimum spanning tree algorithms and shows how they can be used to generate mazes. Watching as the mazes are created is beautiful, so <a href="http://www.jamisbuck.org/presentations/rubyconf2011/index.html#thanks">check them out</a> if that&#8217;s all you get from this post.</p>

<p>In addition he uses these algorithms as examples of deliberate practice, something I&#8217;ll be talking about a lot more, hopefully soon. That&#8217;s because it is important for maximizing one&#8217;s potential productivity, and Jamis makes a <a href="http://www.jamisbuck.org/presentations/rubyconf2011/index.html">convincing case for deliberate practice</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The fact that some programmers are ten times better than others is widely cited and gained a lot of exposure thanks to bloggers like Joel Spolsky. The original experiment to uncover this effect is over 40 years old, and yet the reasons why some are so much more effective than others is poorly understood, in the research and especially among programmers in the field.</p>

<p>This post will hopefully be the start of a series of posts on the differences between the best, worst and median programmers as seen in factors of ten difference in productivity, even when experiments control for experience. I&#8217;ll delve into how an individual programmer can become more like the most effective and productice programmers and how small teams, also affected by large differences in productivity, can make themeselves more competitive and productive. We&#8217;ll tour the psychological studies and mine the software engineering studies to find out what has been proven to work.</p>

<p>Based on the research I&#8217;ve done so far, likely future topics include: increasing efficiency, avoiding rework through design best practices, accurate requirements, focus on quality, doing less through simplicity and reuse, and team programming methodologies such as Agile and CCMI.</p>

<p>Oh, if this sounds like a scholarly research paper &#8230; that&#8217;s because it is based on a paper I did. But now with the new format I can dig even deeper and spend more time on specific issues that didn&#8217;t fit the audience of the actual paper. Hooray for the internet and stay tuned.</p>
